# FUNCTION POINTERS
Pointers to functions are funtions that store the address of other funtions

They point to the code and not data of functions
To declare them, we use parenthesis together with the asterix symbol. 
For instance, void (*fptr)(), is a funtion pointer function having the name fptr and returns void
We can have an array pointer to functions and its declaration is void (*fptr[])(int, char) = {}
